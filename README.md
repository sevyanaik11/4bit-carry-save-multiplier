# 4bit-carry-save-multiplier
The 4-bit Carry Save Multiplier performs fast binary multiplication using carry-save addition to minimize delay. Implemented in Verilog and verified on FPGA, it uses switches for inputs and LEDs for outputs. This design achieves high speed, making it ideal for VLSI and DSP applications.
